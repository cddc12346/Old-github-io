Recently, I chanced upon something cool! Its a python shell running on the Browser. ðŸ¤¯

The technology behind it is `Pyodide` and primarily based on **WebAssembly/Emscripten**. Check out the papers below if you are interested!

1) https://pyodide.org/en/stable/
   
2) https://blog.pyodide.org/talks/2022-pyodide-PyConUS.pdf

You can even do things like `import os` and `open,read,write files` to it! 

Sounds pretty dangerous but everything is done behind a sandbox (hmmmmm).

You can check it out here: [Sexy python shell ðŸ¥³](http://heapmeup.com/pyshell/)

PS: Hahaha I wanted to host it so I can have my own shell to play with. Everyone love shells, right?
