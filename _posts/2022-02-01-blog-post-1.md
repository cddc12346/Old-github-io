It has been more than 1 year playing ctfs and doing RE/pwning. I have also joined a CTF Team in 2021, and they have pushed me to become more active in playing CTF. I felt like in 2021, I have learnt a lot. My achievements for 2021 were I managed to place top three in a few small CTFs, and individually, I managed to complete Flareon 2021!

My 2022 journey I foresee would be doing more heap pwns as well as code review/fuzzing. Hoping to get a CVE to boost up my resume too haha.
