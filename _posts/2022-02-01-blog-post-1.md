It has been more than 1 year playing ctfs and of doing RE/pwning. I have also joined a CTF Team in 2021, and they have pushed me to become more active in playing CTF. In 2021, I have definitely grown a lot. There is still so much to learn but I guess I am still pretty satisfied with my 2021 progress.

My achievements for 2021 were:
1) 2nd in VulnCon CTF
2) 3rd in BSIDES NOIDA 
3) 2nd in IJCTF
4) Flareon 2021 finisher 98th (IceCreamMan)
======

My 2022 Journey will be largely on these areas: 
1) More heap pwns
2) Code review
3) Fuzzing (Hoping to get a CVE to boost up my resume haha)
